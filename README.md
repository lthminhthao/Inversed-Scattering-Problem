# Inversed-Scattering-Problem
My code MatLab for solving Inversed Scattering Problem. This is a part in my bachelor thesis 2017.
My undergraduate thesis is written mainly based on: Gennadi Vainikko, “Fast Solvers of the Lippmann-Schwinger Equation.” (2000).
It studies integral equation formulation on the scattering problem for the Helmholz equation in the homogeneous media.
These codes are based on the method in [Vainikko, 2000]
